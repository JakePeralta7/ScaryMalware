# ScaryMalware

This is a mini-malware I developed in Python as a PoC in order to implement techniques I've learned about

## So, What this malware do?
1. Copies itself to the user profile's folder as .pyw file (run without a visible window) and hides himself (using attrib +h)
2. Checks if someone tried to access the script (the malware himself) and stops if touched
3. Sends a message to the user every 15 seconds "Hello, I'm your malware"
4. Kills known analysis tool
5. Creates persistency as a schedueled task (runs every three hours)
6. Creates persistency in the user's startup folder
7. Runs some reconnaissance commands

## MITRE ATT&CK techniques used in this PoC
### Reconnaissance
### Persistency
### Defense Evasion
